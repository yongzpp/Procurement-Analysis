By Purchase Requisition Number\n","2. By Purchase Order Number\n","\n","The first way is the best because Purchase Requisition Numbers and Purchase Orders Numbers are in a 1 to many relationship, where there can be 1 purchase requisition number for multiple purchase order numbers. However, in the dataset, there are very few rows with a purchase requisition number so the next best alternative is to define a transaction by purchase order number for these rows.\n","\n","Hence, we will split the dataset into 2 parts. The first part is for those rows with a purchase requisition number while the second part is for those rows without a purchase requisition number. Then, we will run the apriori algorithm on each separately, then we will simply combine both rules at the end.\n","\n","For running the apriori algorithm, we will be only generating rules of length 1 only due to space complexity issues. What we meant by length 1 is that for instance, we could have rules like:\n","\n","(apples, oranges) -> bananas\n","\n","This means that if a customer buys both apples and oranges, he is likely to buy bananas too. Here, the length is not 1 because the left hand side has 2 items. For an association rule to be length 1, both sides must contain only 1 item.\n","\n","We will include an association rule if the lift is greater than 1 and the confidence is at least 60%."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FOP6Mxo6GFVO"},"source":["# Purchase Recquisition Number"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c4bX99zmIJXD"},"source":["Remove blank recquisition numbers"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tU_fmTM4H55E"},"source":["pr_df = df[~pd.isna(df['Requisition Number'])]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RXmPuwFAIvFS"},"source":["Retrieve only the final label and pr number for each row"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bll-T-AJIUp4"},"source":["transaction_ids = []\n","product_names = []\n","\n","for index, row in pr_df.iterrows():\n","  trans_id = row['Requisition Number']\n","  pn = row['Final Commodity Title']\n","  transaction_ids.append(trans_id)\n","  product_names.append(pn)\n","\n","new_pr_df = pd.DataFrame()\n","new_pr_df['Transaction Number'] = transaction_ids\n","new_pr_df['Product Name'] = product_names\n","new_pr_df['Quantity'] = [1] * new_pr_df.shape[0]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6snuvgzJunYH"},"source":["# Purchase Order Number"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HyBDWbxLLuVE"},"source":["Find those rows with blank requisition numbers"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LgWl0kJPupOc"},"source":["po_df = df[pd.isna(df['Requisition Number'])]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t3zIFK1ZMAUi"},"source":["Retrieve only the final label and po number for each row"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bpcc_Navuykn"},"source":["transaction_ids = []\n","product_names = []\n","\n","for index, row in po_df.iterrows():\n","  trans_id = row['Purchase Order Number']\n","  pn = row['Final Commodity Title']\n","  transaction_ids.append(trans_id)\n","  product_names.append(pn)\n","\n","new_po_df = pd.DataFrame()\n","new_po_df['Transaction Number'] = transaction_ids\n","new_po_df['Product Name'] = product_names\n","new_po_df['Quantity'] = [1] * new_po_df.shape[0]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NmBu9r813q6g"},"source":["# Generating association rules for both PR and PO"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IUWG1JHXPBn6"},"source":["## Running Apriori for PR"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zLtHX6zKLYFX"},"source":["Generate the basket"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"stiEf8JKf1MK"},"source":["basket = new_pr_df.groupby(['Transaction Number', 'Product Name'])['Quantity'].sum().unstack().fillna(0)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HxMFuglSLZ7E"},"source":["Transform the matrix to a sparse matrix, where the number of columns define the total number of unique items, and each row represents a transaction.
